# CrazyBikeshop

This is a JS web app to buy fictive bikes online: https://crazybikeshop.herokuapp.com/

The main features of the app :
<ul>
  <li>View a catalogue of bikes which you can choose to buy </li>
  <li>View your basket where you can update the number of bikes you want and view the total cost of the transaction</li>
  <li>Login access with crypted password which saves basket</li>
  <li>Pay for your basket with a stripe interface</li>
</ul>

I built this app to learn about:
<ol>
  <li>Setting up a back-end server on <b>node.JS</b> (Express framework)</li>
  <li>Building a simple front end with <b>Bootstrap</b></li>
  <li>Adding animations to display dynamically elements at every refresh (with Animate.css) to let the user reorder cities in list (with Jquery UI)</li>
  <li>Setting up, reading and updating a <b>mongo DB</b> database (Mongoose Framework) with a <b>NoSQL architecture</b></li>
  <li>Using <b>Stripe microservices</b> to let users pay for their purchase </li>
  <li>Using a library to encrypt passwords </li>
